neat1 => pop=15, relu, fitness=>mean
neat2 => pop=50, relu, fitness=>mean
neat3 => pop=15, relu, fitness=>max
neat4 => pop=50, relu, fitness=>max

Seems like pop size doesn't matter too much, mostly still govern by some luck and reward
Mean fitness works better Max fitness, so we can probably conclude that max fitness is too biased


neat7 => first time using the initial scripted 
neat8 => relu, center distance 5
neat9 => sigmoid, center distance 5
neat10 => relu, center distance 10
neat11 => sigmoid, center distance 10
